# Image_Processing_in_Java

This is an Image Processing program built using Java to practice my programming skills. It is also considered a final project for the Java Learning certification of the CodeAcademy course "Learn Java". You can see the certificate via this link: https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/object0080356722/certificates/d3f89367b558583e361640f778191345

The program allows users to modify the image and create different types of colours, shapes and sizes of the given image. 

# Features
1. Gets an image (Image should be indicated in the code lines - it can not be put as an input)
2. After the first method execution, the program uploads a trimmed version of the original image to the same directory. Then, one by one, the following types of images are output/uploaded to the same directory:
  - Original Image with the NEGATIVE colour
  - Original Image with the STRETCHED shape
  - Original Image with the SHRANK shape
  - Original Image in the INVERTED form 
  - Colored Image of Original Image
  - RANDOMly generated image
  - Rectangle
  - Generated RECTANGLE from the original image
You can find examples of the output files within this repository.
